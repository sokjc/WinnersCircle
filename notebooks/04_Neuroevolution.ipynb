    ">Neuroevolution, or neuro-evolution, is a form of artificial intelligence that uses evolutionary algorithms to generate artificial neural networks (ANN), parameters, topology and rules.[1] It is most commonly applied in artificial life, general game playing[2] and evolutionary robotics. The main benefit is that neuroevolution can be applied more widely than supervised learning algorithms, which require a syllabus of correct input-output pairs. In contrast, neuroevolution requires only a measure of a networkâ€™s performance at a task.\n",

    "1. Create a population of CNN model weights called a generation.\n",
    "2. Evaluate the performance of a generation of model weights in our environment. \n",
    "3. Pick the \"fittest\" model weights and cross breed them. Charles Darwin - right here. And yes, we have mutants as well. \n",
    "4. Repeat 1-3 until some kind of stopping criteria is met.\n",

    "Adapt Our Atari Class from the DQN notebook to run our GE algorithm. They will play nicely together. :) Try training a GE algorithm on the same game as you did for DDQN."
